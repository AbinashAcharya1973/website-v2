## Hello World

Routing with NuxtLink component showing page rendered on server side and on client side

---

In this example:

`pages/index.vue` and `pages/about.vue` show how Nuxt server renders the page on first load or on hard refresh and renders the page on client side when navigating using the `<NuxtLink>` component.

## Active Link Classes

Change the default NuxtLink classes and style the active and exact active classes as well as disable prefetch for a specific link

---

In this example:

`layouts/default.vue` shows the styles for `nuxt-link-active` and `nuxt-link-exact-active`.

## Dynamic Pages

Using dynamic pages to fetch data from an API and populate those pages

---

In this example:

`pages/_slug.vue` shows data coming from the route params.

`pages/index.vue` fetches our mountains from our API.

`pages/_continent/_mountain.vue` shows the detail page for each mountain in each continent.

## Nested Pages

How to use the Nuxt Child component to create parent and child pages.

---

In this example:

`pages/parent.vue` contains the `<NuxtChild>` component. Everything on this page will be seen on both the parent and child pages.

`pages/parent/index.vue` contains text that will be replaced when the child links are clicked.

`pages/parent/child.vue` and `pages/parent/child2.vue` will be rendered as parent/child and parent/child2.
