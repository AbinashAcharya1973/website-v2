## Pre-processors

Configuration your application to use pug and sass with style resources to easily add variables to all components.

---

In this example:

`pages/index.vue` uses pug as a template language and sass for styling.

`nuxt.config.js`:

- registers the style resources module.
- contains a `styleResources` property to add `assets/variables.scss`.
- contains a `css` property to add `assets/main.scss`.

`package.json` shows the dependencies needed.

## webpack Assets

Use the assets folder to add css, images and fonts to your application

---

In this example:

`pages/index.vue` shows:

- how to add an image from the assets folder.
- how to add a background image from the assets folder using CSS.
- how to add dynamic images from the assets folder using the data property.

`nuxt.config.js` contains the `css` property for globally adding a css file.

`assets/main.css` shows how to reference the DMSans fonts from the assets folder using the `@font-face` rule.
