## Router Middleware

Using router middleware to set a class to the body so we can then style differently depending on the route

---

In this example:

`store/class.js` sets a class to the body.

`middleware/class.js` uses router middleware to set a class before we enter the route.

`components/Navigation.vue` changes the font size for the route with the name of `router-middleware`.

`nuxt.config.js` contains the `router` property to activate the middleware.

## Named Middleware

Using named middleware to authenticate a user using the store and allow them to visit a page once authenticated

---

In this example:

`pages/named-middleware.vue` contains a `middleware` property with the value of `auth` which is called before a user enters the route.

`middleware/auth.js` checks to see if the user is authenticated and if they aren't it redirects them to the auth page.

`pages/auth.vue` uses the store to authenticate the user.

`store/auth.js` sets the user and password values and redirects the user.

## Anonymous Middleware

Using anonymous middleware to show the analytics of how many times a user visits a page.

---

In this example:

`pages/anonymous-middleware.vue` contains a middleware function which uses the store to call the increment mutation with results from the store displayed on the page.

`store/analytics.js` sets the `pageVisits` to 0 and increments the visits every time the increment function is called.
