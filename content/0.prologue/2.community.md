## Getting Help

At some point, you may find that there's an issue you need some help with.
But don't worry! We're a friendly community of developers and we'd love to help.

### "I can't figure out how to (...)."

You've read through these docs and you think it should be possible, but it's not clear how. The best thing is to [open a GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions).

Please don't feel embarrassed about asking a question that you think is easy - we've all been there! ❤️

Everyone you'll encounter is helping out because they care, not because they are paid to do so. The kindest thing to do is make it easy for them to help you. Here are some ideas:

* _Explain what your objective is, not just the problem you're facing._ "I need to ensure my form inputs are accessible, so I'm trying to get the ids to match between server and client."

* _Make sure you've first read the docs and used your favorite search engine_. Let people know by saying something like "I've Googled for 'nuxt script setup' but I couldn't find code examples anywhere."

* _Explain what you've tried._ Tell people the kind of solutions you've experimented with, and why. Often this can make people's advice more relevant to your situation.

* _Share your code._ People probably won't be able to help if they just see an error message or a screenshot - but that all changes if you share your code in a copy/pasteable format - preferably in the form of a minimal reproduction like a CodeSandbox.

And finally, just ask the question! There's no need to [ask permission to ask a question](https://dontasktoask.com/) or [wait for someone to reply to your 'hello'](https://www.nohello.com/). If you do, you might not get a response because people are waiting for the whole question before engaging.

### "Could there be a bug?"

Something isn't working the way that the docs say that it should. You're not sure if it's a bug. You've searched through the [open issues](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions) but you can't find anything. (if there is a closed issue, please create a new one)

We recommend taking a look at how to report bugs. Nuxt 3 is still in active development, and every issue helps make it better.

## Bug Reports

One of the most valuable roles in open source is taking the time to report bugs helpfully.
Try as we might, we will never completely eliminate bugs.
Even if you can't fix the underlying code, reporting a bug well can enable someone else with a bit more familiarity with the codebase to spot a pattern or make a quick fix.
Here are a few key steps.

### Is It Really a Bug?

Consider if you're looking to get help with something, or whether you think there's a bug with Nuxt itself. If it's the former, we'd love to help you - but the best way to do that is through [asking for help](/docs/community/getting-help) rather than reporting a bug.

### Search the Issues

Search through the [open issues](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions) first. If you find anything that seems like the same bug, it's much better to comment on an existing thread than create a duplicate.

### Create a Minimal Reproduction

It's important to be able to reproduce the bug reliably - in a minimal way and apart from the rest of your project. This narrows down what could be causing the issue and makes it possible for someone not only to find the cause, but also to test a potential solution.

Start with the Nuxt 3 or Nuxt Bridge sandbox and add the **minimum** amount of code necessary to reproduce the bug you're experiencing.

::alert
If your issue concerns Vue 3 or Vite, please try to reproduce it first with the Vue 3 SSR starter.

**Nuxt 3**:

:button-link[Nuxt 3 on CodeSandbox]{href="https://codesandbox.io/p/github/nuxt/starter/v3-codesandbox" blank}

**Nuxt Bridge**:

:button-link[Nuxt Bridge on CodeSandbox]{href="https://codesandbox.io/p/github/nuxt/starter/v2-bridge-codesandbox" blank}

**Vue 3**:

:button-link[Vue 3 SSR on StackBlitz]{href="https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt-contrib/vue3-ssr-starter/tree/main?terminal=dev" blank .mr-2}
:button-link[Vue 3 SSR on CodeSandbox]{href="https://codesandbox.io/p/github/nuxt-contrib/vue3-ssr-starter/main" blank .mr-2}
:button-link[Vue 3 SSR Template]{href="https://github.com/nuxt-contrib/vue3-ssr-starter/generate" blank}

Once you've reproduced the issue, remove as much code from your reproduction as you can (while still recreating the bug). The time spent making the reproduction as minimal as possible will make a huge difference to whoever sets out to fix the issue.

### Figure Out What the Cause Might Be

With a Nuxt project, there are lots of moving pieces - from [Nuxt modules](https://nuxtjs.org/modules) to [other JavaScript libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/). Try to report the bug at the most relevant and specific place. That will likely be the Nuxt module causing an issue, or the upstream library that Nuxt is depending on.


## Ecosystem

The Nuxt ecosystem includes many different projects and organizations. For example:

* [nuxt/](https://github.com/nuxt) - core repositories for the Nuxt framework itself. [**nuxt/nuxt**](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) contains the Nuxt framework (both versions 2 and 3).
* [nuxt-community/](https://github.com/nuxt-community) - community-contributed and maintained modules and libraries. There is a [process to migrate a module](/docs/guide/going-further/modules/#joining-nuxt-community) to `nuxt-community`. While these modules have individual maintainers, they are not dependent on a single person.
* [nuxt-contrib/](https://github.com/nuxt-contrib) - the previous home for libraries that are not specific to Nuxt but produced and used by the Nuxt team.
* [unjs/](https://github.com/unjs) - many of these libraries are used throughout the Nuxt ecosystem. They are designed to be universal libraries that are framework- and environment-agnostic. We welcome contributions and usage by other frameworks and projects.
